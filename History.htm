At Khurja Pottery Hub, we take pride in preserving a rich and storied tradition that dates back to the 
14th century. Our pottery is a testament to the craftsmanship and artistry that has been passed down through generations.
     <br>
Historical Legacy: The roots of Khurja Pottery can be traced back to retreating soldiers and commanders from Timur’s army who 
decided to settle in Khurja, officially establishing the town. Among these settlers were skilled potters who brought their craft 
with them, laying the foundation for what would become a distinguished pottery tradition.
     <br>
Evolution of Artistry: Starting with red clay pottery, the artisans of Khurja gradually honed their skills and experimented with 
different techniques. They transitioned to using blue glaze and began painting intricate floral designs with cupric oxide on red 
clay articles. The addition of a soft glaze containing glass and borax further enhanced the beauty and durability of their 
creations.
     <br>
War-time Resilience: During World War II, a ban was imposed on various metals for making household utensils, leading to a surge in 
demand for ceramic wares. In response to this need, the Government of Uttar Pradesh established a ceramic unit in Khurja. Despite 
facing challenges, the artisans adapted and produced high-quality ceramic goods primarily for war hospitals, showcasing their 
resilience and dedication to their craft.
     <br>
Heritage Reimagined: After the war, the ceramic unit was transformed into a Pottery Development Centre, recognizing the importance 
of preserving this cultural heritage. Today, Khurja Pottery continues to thrive as a symbol of tradition and innovation, blending 
age-old techniques with contemporary designs to meet the needs of modern consumers.
